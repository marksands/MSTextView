# MSTextView

A URL aware TextView for iOS

## Installation

Just copy over `MSTextView.m` and `MSTextView.h` into your project folder and you're all set.

# Using MSTextView

Make sure to include the header file `"MSTextView.h"` and use the protocol `<MSTextViewDelegate>` which is necessary for responding to your code when the user selects a link. The sample project has everything you need to get you started, or check out the code below.

    - (void) viewDidLoad
    {
      NSString *sample = @"Check out my GitHub page http://github.com/marksands or go to http://google.com instead. \
        Optionally, try out a news site such as http://yahoo.com or http://cnn.com";

      MSTextView *textView = [[[MSTextView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 10, 310, 480)] autorelease];
      textView.delegate = self;
      textView.text = sample;
      [self.view addSubview:textView];
    }

    - (void) handleURL:(NSURL*)url
    {
      WebViewController *webview = [[WebViewController alloc] initWithURL:url];
      [self.navigationController pushViewController:webview animated:YES];
      [webview release];
    }
